It is an oft used tactic to wait for the enemy to take the neutral,
lose ships to neutral forces,
and then take the planet from him on the next turn.
(if an enemy just took a neutral planet, and you can take it, take it)

If ships stay put until they are needed for defense or attack
then they may be too far from the action when they are Ùè∞Äfinally needed.
(if many ships build up in one place, make use of them)
